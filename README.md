## 🚦 **Quick Start**

```bash
pip install rollercoaster  # (or clone this repo and pip install -e .)
```

```python
from rollercoaster.api import order_target_percent, record, symbol
from rollercoaster.ml import AutoMLFactor
from rollercoaster.realtime import RealTimeEngine, ProcessingMode
from rollercoaster.risk import HistoricalVaR

# Define your algorithm as usual, but now with ML and real-time!
def initialize(context):
    context.ml_factor = AutoMLFactor(
        inputs=[...],
        target_factor=...,  # e.g. Returns(window_length=1)
        model_type="regression"
    )
    context.var = HistoricalVaR(confidence_level=0.95)

# ...
